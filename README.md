Leaves is primary an example of a ViewPager with a gradient background that changes color.

The app shows everyday a "Leave". It can be a fragment from a book or any phrase at all.
The fisrt page is the "Leave" and the second are the "veins" that explain what that phrase means to you or something you can learn from it.
Anyone can make a Leave and the app shows a new one everyday so we can learn something new everyday from a book or our own imagination.
