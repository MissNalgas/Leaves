# Leaves

![Leaves Logo](/images/leaf.png)

Leaves is primary an example of a ViewPager with a gradient background that changes color.

The app shows everyday a "Leaf". It can be a fragment from a book or any phrase at all.
The fisrt page is the "Leaf" and the second are the "veins" that explain what that phrase means to you or something you can learn from it.
Anyone can make a Leave and the app shows a new one everyday so we can learn something new everyday from a book or our own imagination.

## How to use

The first thing you see when you open Leaves is the Leaf of the day. A phrase or a quote someone post because they thought there is something to learn from it and wanted to share it with the world.

You can swipe right to the last page and see the menu where there is a button that redirects you to a webpage where you can share your leaves to the world.

Every morning a Leaf gets selected and it's sent to the world for us to learn together. If your Leaf gets selected you earn a Stick and build your own Tree.
